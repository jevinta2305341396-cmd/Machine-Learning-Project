# Machine-Learning-Project
This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict diagnostic outcomes. It features a complete workflow: data preprocessing (imputation, scaling), extensive EDA, and the comparative analysis of five classification algorithms (including Random Forest and SVM) using ROC-AUC and F1-scores to optimize prediction accuracy.
